<h1>Description</h1>
This is my small todo application written in React.js using Redux and react-router-dom.
The first project on React.js.
<hr>
The application interface is intuitive and pleasing to the eye.
Functional:
-In it you can of course add tasks by clicking on the plus sign
-There is a counter of completed tasks with sorting by status (completed or not)
-Ability to add task to important
-Splitting to-do lists: all tasks, today's, important
<hr>
P.S. Over time, it’s possible the application’s capabilities will grow, but now development is suspended indefinitely
